The design that every team builds can include the following documents as relevant.

# Documenting Design

1. [System Architecture Diagrams](./docs/system-arch-diag.md): Visual representation of components, data flow, and interfaces.

2. [Data Flow Diagrams](./docs/data-flow-diag.md) - Illustrates how data moves through the system, showing inputs, outputs, and storage points.

3. [Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)](./docs/entity-rel-diag.md) - For database-centric designs, showing how different entities relate to each other.

4. [Sequence Diagrams](./docs/sequence-diag.md) - UML diagrams showing how processes operate with one another and in what order.

5. [API Documentation](./docs/api-doc.md) - For teams designing systems with APIs, detailing endpoints, request/response formats, etc.

6. [Performance Analysis Report](./docs/perf-analysis-report.md) - Template to document expected or simulated performance metrics.

7. [Security Analysis Document](./docs/security-analysis-doc.md) - Outline potential security threats and mitigation strategies.

8. [Scalability Analysis Document](./docs/scalability-analysis-doc.md) - For documenting how the system can scale and under what conditions.
